Hello,
If you wanna test the game theres a few ways to go about it! 

LOCAL PLAY - play on different instances on the same computer

To play with the local multiplayer option, just open the FowlBuild folder
and play the Unity .exe file. You can open this up to four times and host locally
on one and join to the "localhost" on the others.

STEAM PLAY - play with steam friends - they would also have to do this 

In the Steam Library, click on Add a Game. Find the Unity build in the FowlBuild folder.
Then open the game through Steam and click on "Play on Steam". 

Both of these are shown in the video if thats easier.
